<h1>Basic Apartment Filtering</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Java project, consisting of two classes, TestApartments and Apartment, offers a basic apartment management system. In the TestApartments class, users can create and search for apartments based on their minimum bedroom and bathroom requirements. It prompts users to enter these requirements, displays a list of apartments that meet the specified criteria, and informs them if no apartments match. The Apartment class defines the attributes of each apartment, including its apartment number, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, and provides a toString method for printing apartment details. This project serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming in Java and demonstrates a simple apartment filtering system.
